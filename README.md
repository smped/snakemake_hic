# snakemake_hic

This is a template repository for running HiC-Pro under snakemake.
The steps currently implemented are:

1. Download and index the genome
2. Trim raw data using `AdapterRemoval`
3. Run `FastQC` on raw and trimmed data
4. Prepare Files for HiC-Pro
    + Organise genome annotations 
    + Define restriction fragments 
    + Update `hicpro-config.txt` based on `config.yml`

## Setup

HiC-Pro must be installed and visible to this workflow.
Please ensure you have a working installation on your system.
This workflow is built around v3.0.0

- Data must be placed in `data/raw/fastq`
    + Each sample/replicate needs to go in a separate folder. Use the test dataset as a guide.
    + Delete the test data once you have placed yours in the correct folder
- Edit `config/samples.tsv` to reflect the sample names and file names. 
    + Data is assumed to be paired, so only one file needs to be listed per directory
- Edit `config/config.yml`

## Testing

Once all edits are performed and data is uploaded, run:

```
snakemake -n
``` 

This is a dry run to check everything should work as expected.
If the dry run is successful, create the conda environments:

```
snakemake --use-conda --conda-create-envs-only --cores 1
```

This may take a while.
Snakemake creates these in series so only one core is required.

Once complete, create the rulegraph to check everything is as expected.

```
snakemake --rulegraph > rules/rulegraph.dot
dot -Tpdf rules/rulegraph.dot > rules/rulegraph.pdf
```

## Execution

The following will set the workflow running using `12` cores

```
snakemake \
    --use-conda \
    --notemp \
    --cores 12
```
